  function arguments() -> List[String]
  /// Returns the absolute path of the directory of the script that started the run.
  function scriptDirectory() -> String
  /// Returns the value of the environment variable, or `Option.None` when it is not defined.
  function environmentVariable(name: String) -> Result[Option[String], IOError]
  /// Returns the absolute path of the working directory.
  function workingDirectory() -> Result[String, IOError]
end effect
```

Reading the environment of the process.

```benitoite
public effect Exit
  /// Ends the run with the exit status `code`. It does not return.
  function exit[T](code: Integer) -> T
end effect
```

Ending the process.

```benitoite
public effect Run
  /// Starts the command without a shell, waits for it, and returns its exit code and output.
  function run(command: Command) -> Result[Output, IOError]
  /// Starts the command with the standard streams of the script, waits for it, and returns its exit code.
  function runAttached(command: Command) -> Result[Integer, IOError]
  /// Runs `commandLine` with `/bin/sh -c` and returns the result as `run` does. Write only POSIX sh.
  function shell(commandLine: String) -> Result[Output, IOError]
end effect
```
